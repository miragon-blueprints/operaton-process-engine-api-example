# 0006 — Fixed ports for v1, portless as the upgrade path

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-18

## Context

This repo is developed with [Conductor](https://conductor.build), which runs each task in its own git
worktree — potentially several at once. Parallel worktrees that all bind the same ports collide. Two
answers exist: **fixed ports + serialised runs**, or **portless** (stable per-worktree `.localhost`
URLs that avoid collisions). Portless is the nicer end state, but it only wraps what it can slug — a JS
dev server — and this headless stack has no JS dev server at all; everything that wants a port is a
backend process.

## Decision

For v1 we use **fixed ports and serialise the runs.** `.conductor/settings.toml` pins
**backend 8080 / Postgres 5432** (the same table published in `AGENTS.md` — see
[ADR-0005](0005-agents-md-as-the-single-source.md)) and sets **`run_mode = "nonconcurrent"`**, so only
one worktree runs the app at a time and the ports never clash.

**Portless is deferred, deliberately.** None of this stack's collision sources are things portless
wraps:

| Collision source        | Port | Wrapped by portless? |
| ----------------------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| Spring Boot app         | 8080 | ❌ no |
| Postgres                | 5432 | ❌ no |
| Operaton engine schema  | (shared DB schema in Postgres) | ❌ no |

Portless slugs a JS dev server, and this headless stack has none. Every collision source here — the
Spring port, the Postgres port, and the shared engine schema — is **outside what portless wraps**, so
adopting it now would buy nothing while still forcing `nonconcurrent`. It is added complexity for a
problem it cannot address until the backend/DB isolation story is solved.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** dead-simple, predictable URLs; the same ports in dev, tests, CI, and the docs; no
  slug/proxy layer to reason about.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** only one worktree can run the app at once (`nonconcurrent`); truly parallel
  end-to-end runs across worktrees are not possible in v1.
- **Neutral:** per-worktree Postgres/schema isolation is the recorded upgrade path — a future ADR would
  supersede this one once the backend, database, and engine schema can each avoid collision.
